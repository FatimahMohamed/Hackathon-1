## Introduction
Pick a Planet is our first portfolio project, developed following the Code Institute Full Stack Development Bootcamp using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and Jarvascript. It was developed following a set of guidelines,we had a choice of Quiz, Game or API catergories. 

## Project Outline
Pick a Planet was developed as a physics based quiz, to impart knowlege about the planets. General advice is given, a list of resources which should encompass people of all ages, and a form allowing the user to contact the website creators for questions. 

The website follows modern accessibility standards, and is responsive to devices of all screen sizes.

We wanted an all black backround so our baby blue and green tea ombre font would stand out. It also can represent the nights sky an keeps the webpage quite modern.

The website passes the [WAVE](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/wave-evaluation-tool/jbbplnpkjmmeebjpijfedlgcdilocofh) contrast checker on all pages, as well as the [Colour Contrast Checker](https://colourcontrast.cc/).

### Colours Used

- Rich Black `#060018;`    
- Baby Blue`#85c7f2`
- Tea Green `#c3e8bd`
- White `#ffffff`
## Imagery and Theming

We used the planet theme for a quiz. 
beacuase we have an expert in out team and why not put that knowledge out there. ------

I used [paint.net](https://www.getpaint.net/) to remove the background colour of the images for, and [Squoosh](https://squoosh.app/) to compress and convert the images to webp. 

The images were sourced from [Freepik](https://www.freepik.com/), following their [attribution policy](https://support.freepik.com/s/article/Attribution-How-when-and-where?language=en_US). 

---why i choze to make a constant backround-----looks modern 

## Font
paragraph about font---

 The font is consistent for all the text on the website. The titles are distinguished by being larger, having a higher font weight, and the text colour having a slight gradient.

 ## Wireframes

 Wireframes were designed using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/). The final design of the website is slightly different than that of the wireframes, primarily in that the section background colours do not extend to the edges of the page, and the removal of a central image for extremely large screens. The changes were made as I think the website looks nicer this way.
