Pick a Planet is our first portfolio project, developed following the Code Institute Full Stack Development Bootcamp using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and Jarvascript. It was developed following a set of guidelines,we had a choice of Quiz, Game or API catergories. 

## Project Outline
Pick a Planet was developed as a physics based quiz, to impart knowlege about the planets. General advice is given, a list of resources which should encompass people of all ages, and a form allowing the user to contact the website creators for questions. 

The website follows modern accessibility standards, and is responsive to devices of all screen sizes.
